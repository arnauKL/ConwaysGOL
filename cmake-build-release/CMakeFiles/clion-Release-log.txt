CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/depre/Desktop/Personal/Coding/C++/projects/Game_of_life/cmake-build-release/_deps/sfml-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/depre/Desktop/Coding/C++/Game_of_life/cmake-build-release/_deps/sfml-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
